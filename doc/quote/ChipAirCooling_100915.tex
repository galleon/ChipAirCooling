\section*{Scope of Work}

This project proposal and quote has been assembled following the discussions
with EADS Innovation Works India in Bangalore (The Client) as requested on
9~August~2010.

The objective of the project is to perform an air cooling simulation of
electronic chip assemblies.

\section*{Work Package}

The work undertaken in this project consists of the following components:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementation and testing of a conjugate heat transfer solver with the
  following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Steady-state, incompressible flow solver;
  \item Steady-state heat conduction with spatially varying properties
    determined by a material library;
  \item Energy equation is solved in a coupled manner over all components using
    the coupled matrices technology available in OpenFOAM extend;
  \item Radiation modelling (P1);
  \item Boussinesq approximation for buoyancy-driven flow;
  \item Incompressible turbulence model with standard wall-functions or low-Re
    number treatment.
\end{enumerate}

\item Implementation and testing of a transient, conjugate heat transfer solver
  with the characteristics of the solver in item 1;

\item Material properties library for heat capacity, conductivity and heat
  source using face zones to locate the component in the mesh.
  Properties are spatially uniform scalars;

\item Addition of contact heat resistance to material properties library using
  face zones to locate the component in the mesh. Properties are spatially
  uniform scalars;

\item Implementation and testing of a fixed value boundary condition which is
  dependant of a field cell value through an algebraic function provided by the
  Client; \label{item:customBC}

\item Preparation of a tutorial case according to the specifications provided by
  the Client;

\item Running the case, post-processing and preparation of results;

\item Detailed report of the project outcome;

\end{enumerate}
%

The validation of the simulation environment will be carried out by the Client.
Assistance will be provided by Wikki under the current support contract.

\section*{Deliveries of the Client}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mesh consisting of a maximum of 2 regions and 250.000 cells in a file
  format that can be converted to OpenFOAM (including the boundary, region, face
  and cell zone definitions);
\item Boundary conditions;
\item Thermo-physical properties;
\item Algebraic function for item \ref{item:customBC}.
\end{enumerate}
